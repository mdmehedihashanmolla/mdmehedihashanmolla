## 👋 Hi, I’m Mehedi — Web3 Security Researcher & Builder

I’m a Web3 smart contract security researcher with a background in full-stack product development and developer education.

Previously, I **founded Learn2Leads**, an edtech startup where I built and launched the entire platform — from backend infrastructure to user experience. While the company is now closed, it gave me hands-on experience in product thinking, system design, and fast iteration.

I also **co-founded EEA Kolkata**, contributing as a technical trainer and collaborator on developer-focused tools and resources.

These builder-first experiences now shape how I approach smart contract security:  
With a product mindset, a focus on real-world risk, and a mission to catch critical vulnerabilities *before they reach mainnet*.
