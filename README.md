## 👋 Hi, I’m Mehedi — Web3 Security Researcher & Builder

I'm a Web3 smart contract security researcher with a background in full-stack development and real-world product building.

Previously, I founded **Learn2Leads**, an educational platform that I built and launched end-to-end — from backend systems to frontend user experience. I also co-founded **EEA Kolkata**, where I contributed as a technical trainer and product collaborator.

These experiences shaped how I approach smart contract security:  
With a builder’s mindset, deep attention to risk, and a relentless focus on discovering critical vulnerabilities *before they hit mainnet*.

### 🛡️ Currently focusing on:

- 🛡️ Writing competitive audit reports for real-world smart contracts  
- 💥 Conducting vulnerability research with detailed PoCs and mitigation strategies  
- 📊 Reproducing major Web3 hacks with in-depth technical breakdowns  
- 🔧 Developing secure smart contracts and custom auditing tools  
- 🧱 Designing protocol-level systems like vaults, lending platforms, and staking modules  
- 🌐 Building full-stack dApps with deep frontend-to-smart-contract integration
